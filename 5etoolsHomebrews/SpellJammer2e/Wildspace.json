In an emergency, a character can swing on these lines from the rigging to any point aloft, on the deck, or to either castle with a successful acrobatics check. Failure means a fall and 2d6 damage.

Instead, the following Item Saving Throw table is used. This saving throw represents an item's general ability to withstand the effects of the attack. It is rolled just like a normal saving throw (see \"Combat\").",
                        "The item saving throw should be used only when the item is not being carried by a character or when a character fails his saving throw against the same attack. A character who successfully saves against the blast of a fireball spell need not make separate saving throws for his potions. The character who failed the same save failed to protect himself adequately and must therefore check for his potions (and probably his scrolls, too). Not all items need make a save in every instance. It is perfectly reasonable to ignore the save for a character's sword and armor in the same fireball situation described above, since there is so little chance that these will be affected.",

Items with a plus (a sword +1, for example) gain that plus as a bonus to the die roll. If the item possesses additional special abilities, it should have an extra plus for each of these. Magical items with no stated pluses should gain a bonus relative to their power. A potion would have a +1 while a miscellaneous magical item could have a +5 or +6. Further, if the saving throw is versus an attack the device was designed to counter (e.g., extreme cold vs. a ring of warmth), an additional bonus of +2 is allowed."

The whispering wind can travel as many miles above ground as the spellcaster has levels of experience, to a specific location within range that is familiar to the wizard. The whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. The wizard can prepare the spell to bear a message of up to 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for one round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air that has a susurrant sound. He can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as a mile per hour or as quickly as a mile per turn. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains until the message is delivered. As with the magic mouth spell, no spells may be cast via the whispering wind."
